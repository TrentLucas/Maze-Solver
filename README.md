# Maze-Solver

Finds the shortest path in a given maze text file. The first line of the text file contains 4 values which represent the maze width, maze height, startX, and startY. The end point is represented by a 'o' placed in the maze. The program travels through every possible path and stores the shortest distance value from the start to the node it is current in. Once the program reaches the end, it then goes from the end to the start through the nodes which signify the shortest path. After this, the program will draw the shortest path.
